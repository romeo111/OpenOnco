"""ExperimentalOption — clinical-trial track in a Plan.

Per docs/plans/ua_ingestion_and_alternatives_2026-04-26.md §2.3.

A single-(disease, biomarker_profile, line_of_therapy) container holding
the active recruiting / active-not-recruiting trials returned from
ClinicalTrials.gov. Generated, not curated. Render exposes these as a
third Plan track alongside the engine-selected standard + alternative.

Engine semantics: `ExperimentalOption` is render-time-only metadata. It
NEVER influences which Indication / Regimen the engine picks for the
default or alternative tracks (CHARTER §8.3 + the "show all alternatives"
invariant from `feedback_efficacy_over_registration.md`).

`TrialOutlook` (added 2026-05-07) is a per-trial structured signal
bundle — biomarker-stratification detection + design-quality flags,
computed by `engine.trial_outlook.score_trial`. Like the rest of this
track, it's render-time-only metadata: never read back as a selection
signal. v1 ships two signals (`biomarker_stratification`,
`design_flags`); mechanism-precedent scoring is deferred to a follow-up.
