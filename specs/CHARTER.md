# Charter and Governance

**Project:** OpenOnco
**Version:** v0.1 (draft)
**Date:** [publication date]
**Status:** Draft for public comment

---

## 1. Project purpose

To give an oncologist the ability to **obtain a structured view of a case within minutes** in the form of two alternative treatment plans (less and more intensive) based on patient data, with full source citations and an honest description of trade-offs.

The project is an **information resource to support tumor board discussion**, not a system that makes clinical decisions. All recommendations require verification by the treating physician and multidisciplinary discussion before application.

---

## 2. What the project does and does not do

**Does:**
- Accepts structured patient data (diagnosis, stage, histology, biomarkers, comorbidities, prior treatment)
- Applies an approved knowledge base (NCCN, ESMO, WHO Classification, Ukrainian Ministry of Health protocols)
- Generates **one document (Plan)** with several alternative plans (tracks: standard / aggressive / optionally others) presented in parallel for tumor board discussion. Versioned upon receipt of new data.
- Cites sources for each recommendation
- Explicitly flags unknown parameters and red flags

**Does not:**
- Prescribe drugs automatically
- Integrate with EHR to execute actions
- Replace the physician's clinical decision
- Claim to provide recommendations for rare or exceptional cases
- Work with pediatric patients (scope — adults)
- Constitute a medical device in the regulatory sense (per §15)
- **Is not intended for patients / caregivers directly** — HCP only (oncologist/hematologist in a clinical context). Direct-to-patient deployment would require re-classification as a medical device — outside CHARTER scope (per §15).
- **Is not intended for time-critical/urgent decisions** — outpatient planning only. Acute conditions (active TLS management, neutropenic fever, spinal cord compression) — outside scope (per §15).

---

## 3. Scope (at MVP stage)

**Included:**
- First-line treatment for confirmed diagnoses
- Adult hemato-oncology (starting area)

**Not included in MVP:**
- Relapsed/refractory scenarios
- Pediatrics
- Solid tumors (planned after hematology stabilization)
- Automatic EHR action execution

**First diagnoses to cover:**
- [Diagnosis 1] — reference case with a verification document
- [Diagnosis 2] — TBD after Phase 1

---

## 4. Team and roles

### 4.1. Permanent roles

**Project Initiator / Coordinator:** [name]
Coordinates team work, manages communication, responsible for public representation. Has no authority to approve clinical content.

**Clinical Co-Leads:** [name 1], [name 2], [name 3]
Three practicing oncologists (at least one must be a hematologic oncologist for the relevant domain). Each approves clinical content in their domain. Simultaneous agreement from two of three is required to merge clinical changes.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Coding Agent A: [name/version, e.g., Claude Code]
- Coding Agent B: [name/version]
- LLM models for auxiliary tasks: [list of models]

Detailed rules for working with AI tools — section 8.

### 4.2. What "three physicians" means

At the MVP stage, clinical governance rests on three people. This is a deliberate constraint, which implies:

- At least two of three must approve every clinical change
- Disagreement → a one-week pause for reconciliation; if needed, an external clinician is brought in for consultation
- If one person is unavailable — clinical merges are suspended until a minimum of two active reviewers are restored
- Escalation for complex disagreements: consultation with a relevant professional society (ESMO, EHA, ASCO) or an expert at a partner institution

### 4.3. What we are looking for going forward

The project is explicitly seeking to expand Clinical Co-Leads to 5–7 people through:
- Academic partnership with a medical institution
- Engagement of oncologist-residents and fellows as associate contributors
- International advisory (Ukrainian clinicians in the EU/USA)

---

---

## 6. Clinical change process

### 6.1. Standard workflow

> **⚠ Temporary dev mode (from 2026-04-26):** the project is in the v0.1
> phase (specs-first / KB-bootstrap). Clinical Co-Leads have not yet been
> appointed, so two-reviewer signoff at the PR level is **temporarily
> considered "OK"** for merge under the following conditions: (a) the
> content has ≥1 cited primary source, (b) all Indication / Regimen /
> RedFlag entities remain marked as `STUB` (`reviewer_signoffs: 0`),
> (c) no Plan built from this KB is published to patients outside
> synthetic / demo mode.
> This exemption is in effect until Clinical Co-Leads are appointed or
> until the first production deployment for real HCP users — whichever
> comes first.
> Tracker: roadmap → "Operations → Reviewer signoff workflow".

1. **Proposal:** Contributor creates a PR with a clinical change.
   Required fields: description, rationale, sources (minimum 1 primary),
   evidence level, impact on existing recommendations.

2. **Triage:** One of the Clinical Co-Leads (rotating) assigns two
   reviewers within 7 days.

3. **Medical review:** Two independent clinicians within 14 days.
   Standardized checklist: accuracy of citations, consistency with
   current guidelines, contradictions, evidence level, completeness.

4. **Reconciliation:** If reviewers agree — merge. If they disagree —
   discussion; if needed, a third clinician or public disclosure of
   both positions with a "controversy" label (analogous to NCCN category 2B).

5. **Technical review:** Verification of format, schema validity, test coverage.

6. **Automated tests:** Against a test patient cohort (synthetic + de-identified
   real cases).

7. **Merge + changelog:** Public record with authors, reviewers, sources,
   version.

8. **Post-merge flag:** First 30 days — status "recent", priority on
   bug reports.

### 6.2. Emergency pathway

For safety-critical changes (drug recall, new contraindication, FDA alert):
- One of the Clinical Co-Leads + one additional clinician (may be an
  external expert) may approve an emergency change
- Full review — within 7 days post-merge
- Explicit "emergency update" label in changelog

### 6.3. Deprecation

Outdated recommendations are not removed immediately:
- Deprecation period — 6 months with an explicit warning
- Archival access is preserved forever
- Changelog explains the reasons for the change

---

## 7. Transparency

### 7.1. Always public

- All accepted clinical changes with full metadata
- Changelog with complete history
- CoI declarations of all Clinical Co-Leads
- Governance documents
- Meeting minutes (if formal meetings are held)
- Contribution guidelines
- Known clinical issues

### 7.2. Private

- Real patient data for testing (de-identified only, in a separate
  access-controlled repository)
- Preliminary drafts before initial reviews

### 7.3. Conflict of Interest

> **⚠ Temporary dev mode (from 2026-04-26):** Clinical Co-Leads have not
> yet been appointed, so CoI declarations are **temporarily considered "OK"**
> as "absent / N/A". Once the first Co-Lead is confirmed — the declaration
> is published before their first voting participation. This exemption is
> synchronized with the §6.1 dev mode.

All Clinical Co-Leads declare annually:
- Consulting for pharmaceutical companies
- Speaking fees
- Research grants
- Equity / ownership in medical ventures
- Family ties with industry

Declarations are public on the project website. When discussing recommendations
relating to drugs with declared CoI, the relevant Co-Lead recuses from voting
on that change.

## 8. Rules for working with AI tools

This is a new section for OSS governance, driven by the specifics of the project.

### 8.1. Classification of AI use

**Permitted without special restrictions:**
- Boilerplate code generation
- Documentation assistance
- Refactoring existing code
- Unit test generation
- UI/UX components

**Permitted with heightened attention:**
- Generation of prose sections for patient/physician documents based on
  structured data
- Extraction of structured data from clinical documents (pathological
  reports, medical records) — with mandatory human verification
- Translation between languages (EN/UK) — with clinical review

**Prohibited:**
- Selecting clinical recommendations (this is rule-based from the knowledge base)
- Determining drug doses
- Interpreting biomarkers for treatment selection
- "Filling gaps" in patient data
- Generating medical content for the knowledge base without citations

### 8.2. Audit trail for AI contributions

- Code generated by an AI coding agent is marked in the commit message
  (e.g., `[agent:claude-code]`)
- The human contributor who merges AI-generated code bears the same
  responsibility as for their own code
- LLM-generated prose sections in documents are marked with a separate tag
  `<!-- ai-generated, reviewed by: [name] -->`
- Weekly log of AI tool usage: which models were used, for which tasks

### 8.3. Prohibited prompt patterns

- "Write a recommendation for..."
- "What is the best therapy for..."
- "Generate a dose for drug X..."
- Anything that makes the LLM the actual clinical decision-maker

All clinical reasoning goes through declarative rules in the knowledge base,
executed by the rule engine. The LLM works only with the output, not in place
of it.

### 8.4. Validation of AI-generated output

- Prose sections produced by LLM: mandatory clinical verification before
  first publication, periodic audits
- Extraction results: random sample audit for accuracy
- Coding agents: standard code review + test coverage

---

## 9. Safety and error handling

### 9.1. Reporting clinical errors

- Public issue tracker with the `clinical-error` tag
- Alternative private channel for sensitive reports: [email]
- SLA: triage — 48 hours, assessment — 7 days, fix for critical — ASAP

### 9.2. Hall of Responsibility

- Public credit for reporters (if they consent)
- Public post-mortem analysis of critical errors with lessons learned
- List of known issues — always available

### 9.3. Patient zero (reference case)

The project publishes one reference clinical case as a demonstration of how
the system should work. Requirements:

- **The patient provided informed consent** for their case to be used as
  a public reference
- **All identifying information has been removed** (names, initials, exact
  dates, institution, region, any combination of data allowing re-identification)
- **Ethics committee approval** from the institution where treatment was
  provided
- Case is available in the public repository as "Reference Case #0"
- If consent is withdrawn — the case is removed from public access

Until all of these conditions are met — the case remains internal, not public.

---

## 10. Versioning

### 10.1. Knowledge base

Semantic versioning by diagnosis:
- **MAJOR** (x.0.0): breaking change in recommendations (change of preferred regimen)
- **MINOR** (0.x.0): new option without removing the old one
- **PATCH** (0.0.x): correction, clarification, new source

### 10.2. Retention

- ALL versions of the knowledge base are stored indefinitely
- Each generated document contains a snapshot of the versions used
- Retrospective reconstruction of the knowledge state at any date is possible

---

## 11. Disclaimer policy

Standard disclaimer on all system outputs:

> This document was generated by the [Name] information system to support
> discussion of a clinical case. It **is not a medical recommendation** and
> **does not replace the decision of the treating physician**. All recommendations
> require verification by a physician with access to the patient's full
> clinical picture and multidisciplinary team discussion.
>
> Knowledge base version: [X.Y.Z], generation date: [date], sources: [list].
> If in doubt, consult healthcare professionals.

The text is standardized and is not negotiated on a per-case basis.

---

## 12. Governance of this Governance document

- Changes to this document — by consensus of all three Clinical Co-Leads
  + Project Coordinator
- 7-day public comment period before a final decision
- Changes are recorded in the CHANGELOG of this document

---

## 13. Current status and limitations

**What we know at this point:**
- Governance is exclusively for the MVP stage (1–2 diagnoses, team up to 10 people)
- Scaling will require formalization into a foundation-style structure
- Regulatory status for now — information resource, not a medical device
- The project has not undergone a formal clinical validation study

**What is planned as we grow:**
- Expansion of the Clinical Editorial Board to 7+ people
- Domain Working Groups for each clinical area
- Formal legal structure (non-profit foundation)
- Clinical validation studies with peer-reviewed publications
- Regulatory strategy (educational resource → research →
  medical device, if relevant)

**Known limitations:**
- Dependence on three clinicians at the start — single points of failure
- Limited range of diagnoses covered
- Absence of real-world deployment validation
- Ukraine-specific regulatory situation not fully addressed

## 15. FDA Non-Device CDS Positioning

OpenOnco is deliberately designed to **meet all four criteria of §520(o)(1)(E)
of the FD&C Act** (carve-out of the 21st Century Cures Act 2016, FDA
interpretation — `specs/Guidance-Clinical-Decision-Software_5.pdf`,
Source `SRC-FDA-CDS-2026`). Software that satisfies all four criteria **is
not a medical device** and is not subject to FDA premarket review.

This section is an engineering best-effort positioning statement, not legal
advice. A formal regulatory review is required before US deployment.

### 15.1. The four criteria and how OpenOnco addresses them

**Criterion 1 — NOT image / IVD signal / signal-pattern processor.**
- OpenOnco accepts **extracts** (radiology report text, lab results as numbers
  with LOINC codes, biomarker statuses), not raw signals or images
- Genomic data — as structured variants from validated NGS pipelines (via
  CIViC / OncoKB references), not raw FASTQ
- **Red line:** never ingest PET/CT pixels, ECG waveforms,
  or raw NGS reads directly

**Criterion 2 — display/analyze/print medical information.**
- Patient profile (mCODE / FHIR per `DATA_STANDARDS`)
- We cite guidelines (NCCN, ESMO, EASL, Ministry of Health protocols), drug labels
  (FDA, EMA), peer-reviewed RCTs, government recommendations — all of this is
  explicitly "medical information" per FDA Guidance §IV(2)

**Criterion 3 — recommendations to HCP about prevention/diagnosis/treatment.**
- Output: `Plan` with several `tracks` (≥2: standard + aggressive) — this is
  a **list / prioritized list of treatment options**, exactly the
  non-device pattern in FDA Examples V.A.9, V.A.10, V.B.2
- HCP-only by design (§2). **Direct-to-patient deployment = device.**
  Permanent constraint.
- No "specific directive" — `Plan.tracks[].is_default` marks the
  engine's selection, but `automation_bias_warning` explicitly reminds
  that both tracks are presented for HCP review

**Criterion 4 — HCP can independently review the basis.**
- `Plan.fda_compliance` block (FDA Criterion 4 metadata) is mandatory
  surfaced in every render: `intended_use`, `hcp_user_specification`,
  `patient_population_match`, `algorithm_summary`, `data_sources_summary`,
  `data_limitations`, `automation_bias_warning`, `time_critical`
- Rule engine — transparent YAML, not opaque ML; `Plan.trace` records
  every decision-tree step
- Each Indication has `rationale` + `sources[]` Citations with PMID/DOI/URL
- Versioning ([§10.2](#10-versioning)) provides reproducibility

### 15.2. Critical constraints (violation = loss of non-device status)

| # | Constraint | What becomes a device |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | HCP-only, never patient-facing | Direct-to-patient → device |
| C2 | Outpatient/non-time-critical only (`Indication.time_critical: false`) | Acute/emergency modules → device |
| C3 | No raw image / signal / NGS read input | Adding such → device |
| C4 | Always ≥2 tracks, never single binding directive | "System prescribes X" UX → device |
| C5 | Sources must be **established / well-understood** (NCCN/ESMO/RCT/regulatory labels) | Novel biomarker discovery without published evidence → device |
| C6 | Render UI must avoid automation-bias patterns | Pre-selected "accept", buried alternatives, missing rationale → device |
| C7 | No treatment recommendations without confirmed histology — diagnostic-phase MDT may suggest workup steps and team composition, but treatment Plan generation is mechanically blocked when `patient.disease.id` / `icd_o_3_morphology` absent (per `specs/DIAGNOSTIC_MDT_SPEC.md` §1.2) | Bypassing histology gate to produce treatment tracks → device + clinical-safety risk |

### 15.3. Changes that trigger re-classification

Any of the following changes must pass a governance review (§6) **before**
implementation:

- Adding a time-critical Indication (toggle `time_critical: true`)
- Adding an image / signal / raw NGS input pathway
- Pivot to a patient-facing version
- Removing an alternative track ("system chooses one")
- Hiding or removing rationale / sources / trace from the render
- Adding a novel biomarker prediction without published primary evidence
- Transitioning to a commercial deployment model (also triggers a license
  audit per `SOURCE_INGESTION_SPEC §4.3`)

### 15.4. Other jurisdictions

This section is written with **US FDA** as the global gold standard.
- **Ukraine:** Ministry of Health regulation is less formalized for CDS;
  the "decision-support ≠ decision-making" principle applies.
- **EU:** MDR (Medical Device Regulation) has a similar carve-out for CDS,
  but interpretation is stricter — a separate review is needed for an EU launch.
- **UK:** MHRA is broadly aligned with the FDA on CDS positioning.

OpenOnco's design satisfies the **strictest** common denominator (FDA
Criterion 4 transparency requirements); other jurisdictions should be
strictly easier to clear.
